# Project Goal

EOX is our partner in the Minerva project, and they specialize in geospatial databases. EOX and most of their projects are very keen on supporting open standards such as OGC and so on. In the course of their collaboration with ESA in the Copernicus programme they built a public interface to Earth observation data collected by the Sentinel-2 orbiter available as a REST service. Nowadays, everything is a REST service, which simple means that certain parameters in a URL are your query parameters and you get data back via an http request, typically an xml or json file. This URL provides a REST service adhereng to open search standards [http://ows.eox.at/evo-odas/eoxserver/opensearch/collections/sentinel2/json/](http://ows.eox.at/evo-odas/eoxserver/opensearch/collections/sentinel2/json/). Our goal is to build a small mockup with Aardvark.Media, which queries this REST service and interprets and visualizes the data provide in the form of GeoJSON.
